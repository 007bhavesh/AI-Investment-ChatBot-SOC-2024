##### Task 1

**Objective**: Implement basic forecasting models you have learned in Python. Use data from Nifty 50 or any other source you prefer. Utilize the `yfinance` library to fetch the data.

**Instructions**:

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Use the `yfinance` library to download historical stock price data.
    - Choose a stock or index (e.g., Nifty 50) and specify the date range for the data.

2. **Data Preparation**:
    - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Ensure the data is preprocessed appropriately (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing if necessary).

3. **Model Implementation**:
    - Implement the following forecasting models:
        - ARIMA
        - SARIMA
        - Exponential Smoothing
    - Feel free to implement additional models if you are comfortable with them.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Train your models using the training set.
    - Validate the models using the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters.
    - Test the models on the test set and evaluate their performance.

5. **Results Presentation**:
    - Show the predictions of each model and compare them with the actual values.
    - Visualize the results using plots (e.g., line plots for actual vs predicted values).
    - Calculate and display relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to evaluate the models' performance.

6. **Documentation**:
    - Document your code clearly, explaining each step and the reasoning behind it.
    - Include comments in your code to enhance readability and understanding.
    - Provide a summary of your findings and insights from the model comparison.

**Deliverables**:
- A Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the code for data collection, model implementation, and results visualization.
- A brief report summarizing your approach, model performance, and any challenges faced during the implementation.
